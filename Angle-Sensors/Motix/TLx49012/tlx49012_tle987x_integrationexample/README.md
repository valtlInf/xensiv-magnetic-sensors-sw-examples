### 1.1. Short description

This example code performs continuous readouts of the TLx49012 angle sensor registers via SPI, at a frequency of ~20Hz.<br> 
SPI In-Frame addressing scheme is used and exemplified.<br>
For easier interpretation and visualization, the following data is transmitted to the serial port:
- Register angle value, in LSB;
- Calculated angle value, in degrees;

Peripheral configuration is detailed in **Section 3**. <br>

>Note: The provided example is not a qualified solution and is provided "as-is".

<br>

## 2. Getting started

### 2.1. Hardware connections

The block diagram below shows the required connections between the TLx49012 angle sensor and the TLE987x evaluation boards.<br>
Both TLE987x evaluation kits for development (TLE987x VQFN EvalBoard and TLE9879 EvalKit) have identical, labeled pin-outs.<br>
Additional components, such as **decoupling capacitors**, are not depicted. **Please refer to the [TLx49012 datasheet](https://www.infineon.com/assets/row/public/documents/24/49/infineon-tle49012-s0001-datasheet-en.pdf) for more details!** <br>

### 2.2 Necessary software

In order to access all the features of the code example, the following software is required:
- **Keil µVision5 IDE**, version 5.43.1.0. 
    - IDE of choice for this example code, as it is compatible with the TLE987x microcontroller family.
    - For more details about the software, check the [official Keil MDS-ARM v5.xx website](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm).
- **Infineon MCU Config Wizard V2.7.6**, for peripheral configuration.
    - This tool is free to download for users with a myInfineon account. 
    - Find the software on the **Infineon Development Center (IDC) Launcher**, or [online](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/assets/com.ifx.tb.tool.ifxconfigwizardforembeddedpowerics).
- In case the example code flashes correctly, but the serial port does not display any information, make sure to update the J-Link driver of the on-board debugger using the **J-Link Commander**. <br>

### 2.3. Project importing in Keil µVision5; 

Once installed, the example code project can be imported onto your machine:
1. Create a new folder that will act as your Keil µVision5 workspace;
1. Inside the created folder, right click, Git Bash Here, clone the code example repository;
1. Project can be opened directly, by double-clicking the `TLx49012_TLE987x_IntegrationExample.uvprojx` file, or by opening the Keil µVision5 IDE and selecting **Project > Open Project** from the toolbar.

### 2.4. DFP installation in Keil µVision5

After flashing, power cycle the board, or press the on-board RESET button.

<br>

## 3. Peripheral configuration

This chapter represents a rundown of the configuration done in the **MCU Config Wizard** for the peripherals used in the example code, and can be used as a reference or for configuring a new project:
- **SSC1**, for SPI communication with the sensor;
- **PORT**, for GPIO configuration of the SPI Chip Select pin;
- **UART2**, for UART communication with the PC.

To open the MCU Configuration Wizard, go to the toolbar and select **Tools > MCU Config Wizard V2.7.6**.<br>
In case the option is not available, restart the Keil µVision5 IDE and try again.<br>

## 4. Firmware

This chapter provides insight into the firmware structure and program flow. <br>

### 4.1. Library organization

The Keil µVision5 IDE does not allow for multi-layer folder hierarchy, so the file explorer inside the IDE does not reflect the actual folder structure of the project. <br> 

Inside the project, the folder `src` houses all the functionalities of this example code:
- `Controller` folder contains all the microcontroller-specific and peripheral functions:
    - `TLE987x_UART` folder contains the UART serial port data formatting/transmission functions;
    - `TLE987x_SPI` folder contain the SPI initialization sequence and the low-level SPI data transfer function;
    - `TLE987x_GPIO` folder contains GPIO abstraction functions and the NCS pin defines;
- `Sensor` folder contains TLx49012-specific information:
    - `TLx49012.c/h` contain definitions particular to the sensor, as well as the initialization sequence (soft-fusing, disabling CRC checks etc.);
    - `Interface` folder contains the high-level SPI in-frame data transfer functions, complete with 32-bit command generation and CRC.

### 4.2. Initialization

At the beginning of the program, the function 'TLE_init()' initializes the peripherals with the settings applied in **MCU Config Wizard**, particularly focusing on hardware connections.<br>
This function is present by default upon creating a new project using the Keil µVision5 toolchain and the official DFP's.

### 4.3. Available functions

This chapter provides a list of the functions available in this example code.


**void TLx49012_Init(void)**
> This function initializes the sensor by sending SPI commands. <br>
> The CRC LUT is populated with values, for faster computation when CRC calculus is needed. <br>
> A 550us delay is applied to ensure the SPI bus is active, assuming the sensor has just been powered on. <br>
> The first SPI command unlocks the internal registers, so that new data can be written. <br>
> Next, the Bitmap CRC checks are disabled by writing to the `STAT_EN_1` register. <br>
> A read-back verification is performed; if the sensor does not respond correctly, execution is halted with an assertion error. <br>
> The sensor is then soft-configured by writing to the `USR_CONFIG_1` register. <br>
> Finally, the sensor is reset from VM memory using the `STAT_EN` register, so register contents are maintained. A 900us delay is applied to wait for SPI to become active again. <br>
> A second read-back verification checks that the configuration was correctly applied after reset; if not, execution is halted. <br>
> Sensor is ready to receive further commands upon successful completion.

<br>

**uint32_t TLx49012_SPI_WriteInFrame(uint8_t addr, uint16_t data)**
> This function represents the high-level SPI write-in-frame sequence, as described in the sensor datasheet. <br>
> A 32-bit write command is issued to the sensor, composed of the address, WRITE bit, 16-bit data (LSB-first) and calculated CRC. <br>
> Sensor response is received in the same SPI transfer frame. <br>
> `uint8_t addr` - Register address to which data is written. <br>
> `uint16_t data` - Data to be written to sensor register. <br>
> Returns `uint32_t` sensor response.

<br>

**uint32_t TLx49012_SPI_ReadInFrame(uint8_t addr, bool clearStatus)**
> This function represents the high-level SPI read-in-frame sequence, as described in the sensor datasheet. <br>
> A 32-bit read command is issued to the sensor, composed of the address, READ bit, 0x00 byte, device status clear byte, and calculated CRC. <br>
> If the device status byte is all 1's (0xFF), the device status is cleared.
> Sensor response is received in the same SPI transfer frame. <br>
> `uint8_t addr` - Register address from which data is read. <br>
> `bool clearStatus` - Signals whether device status is cleared or not upon command completion. <br>
> Returns `uint32_t` sensor response.

<br>

**uint16_t TLx49012_GetAngleLSB(void)**
> This function reads the content of the register at address 15. <br>
> From the 32-bit sensor response, the status and CRC bytes are ignored. <br>
> Returns `uint16_t` angle value in LSB.

<br>

**void TLE987x_UART_SendAngleInfo(uint16_t angle)**
> This function displays on the serial port the register angle value [LSB] and the calculated angle value [degrees]. <br>
> `uint16_t angle` - angle value in LSB to be converted to degrees, both values sent to serial port.

<br>

## 5. Implementation Example

- **Baudrate**: 115200
- **Data bits**: 8
- **Stop bits**: 1
- **Parity**: none
- **Newline at**: CR
