# PSoC6: Tooth Wheel Speed Measurement

*Disclaimer: This is a community code example (CCE) released for the benefit of the community users. These projects have only been tested for the listed BSPs, tools versions, and toolchains documented in this readme. They are intended to demonstrate how a solution / concept / use-case can be achieved on a particular device. For official code examples, please click [here](https://github.com/Infineon/Code-Examples-for-ModusToolbox-Software).*

This code example demonstrates how to measure the speed of a rotating tooth wheel using the TLE4922 speed sensor and PSoC6 microcontroller. The sensor outputs a PWM signal corresponding to the wheel rotation, which is read by the PSoC6. An interrupt is triggered on every rising edge of the PWM signal, allowing the calculation of the instantaneous speed based on the known pitch length of the wheel. Additionally, the system calculates the average speed when the wheel stops, defined as no pulse detected for 2 seconds.

This setup is implemented using the ModusToolBox Eclipse-based IDE and Tera Term for UART communication, providing real-time speed monitoring and accurate average speed calculation for various applications.

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSoC6: Tooth Wheel Speed Measurement" is displayed on the UART terminal.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/UART_Output.png)

   

5. Confirm that the kit LED blinks at approximately 1 Hz.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

<mark> Add the below Note for relevant CCEs only, like PSoC 6 MCU based. Remove this note for others.

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

This code provides a comprehensive solution for ensuring wheel rotation and speed using the TLE4922 speed sensor and PSoC6 microcontroller. It demonstrates the use of HAL APIs for sensor interfacing and real-time speed calculations. 

1. Interrup Service Routine (ISR):
   - Triggered on each rising edge detected by the sensor. 
   - Calculates the time difference between the current and last pulse. 
   - Computes the instantaneous speed and updates the total distane and total time. 
2. Timer Callback:
   - Checks if the wheel is sopped by comparing the current time with the last pulse time. 
   - If the wheel has stopped (no pulse for 2 seconds), it calculates the average speed based on total distance and tme. 
3. Main function:
   - Initializes the GPIO for the sensor and the timer.
   - Registers the ISR and timer callback.
   - Starts the timer and enables interrupt.
